# Groovy Git

NOTE: This implementation is a fork of the Andrew J. Oberstar's https://github.com/ajoberstar/grgit[grgit] project with a reset of the
version numbering scheme.
It was ensured to build and run under Java 11 and Gradle 5.
Windows implementation details and documentation has been removed.
The package structure and documentation have been adjusted;
all references to original authors and versions have been removed for clarity and consistency.

https://eclipse.org/jgit/[JGit] provides a powerful Java API for interacting with Git repositories. However,
in a Groovy context, it feels very cumbersome, making it harder to express the operations you want to perform
without being surrounded by a lot of cruft.

Groovy Git is a wrapper over JGit that provides a fluent API for interacting with Git repositories in Groovy-based
tooling. Features that require more user interaction (such as resolving merge conflicts) are intentionally excluded.

It also provides a Gradle plugin to easily get a Groovy Git instance.

Groovy Git is available from Maven or the Gradle Plugin Portal.
