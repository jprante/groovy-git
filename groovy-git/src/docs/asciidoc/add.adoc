  patterns = ['<path>', ...]

== Description

This command updates the index using the current content found in the working tree, to prepare the content staged for the next commit. It typically adds the current content of existing paths as a whole, but with some options it can also be used to remove paths that do not exist in the working tree anymore.

The "index" holds a snapshot of the content of the working tree, and it is this snapshot that is taken as the contents of the next commit. Thus after making any changes to the working tree, and before running the commit command, you must use the add command to add any new or modified files to the index.

This command can be performed multiple times before a commit. It only adds the content of the specified file(s) at the time the add command is run; if you want subsequent changes included in the next commit, then you must run `add` again to add the new content to the index.

The status command can be used to obtain a summary of which files have changes that are staged for the next commit.

Please see commit for alternative ways to add content to a commit.

== Options

patterns:: (`Set<String>`, default `[]`) Files to add content from. A leading directory name (e.g. `dir` to add `dir/file1` and `dir/file2`) can be given to update the index to match the current state of the directory as a whole (e.g. specifying `dir` will record not just a file `dir/file1` modified in the working tree, a file `dir/file2` added to the working tree, but also a file `dir/file3` removed from the working tree.
update:: (`boolean`, default `false`) Update the index just where it already has an entry matching `patterns`. This removes as well as modifies index entries to match the working tree, but adds no new files.
+
If no `pathspec` is given when `update` option is used, all tracked files in the entire working tree are updated.

== Examples

To add specific files or directories to the path. Wildcards are not supported.

[source, groovy]
----
git.add(patterns: ['1.txt', 'some/dir'])
----

To add changes to all currently tracked files.

[source, groovy]
----
