== Description

Clones a repository into a newly created directory, creates remote-tracking branches for each branch in the cloned repository, and creates and checks out an initial branch that is forked from the cloned repository’s currently active branch.

After the clone, a plain link:fetch.html[fetch] without arguments will update all the remote-tracking branches, and a link:pull.html[pull] without arguments will in addition merge the remote master branch into the current master branch.

This default configuration is achieved by creating references to the remote branch heads under `refs/remotes/origin` and by initializing `remote.origin.url` and `remote.origin.fetch` configuration variables.

Returns a Groovy Git instance.

== Options

dir:: (`Object`, default `null`) The directory the repository should be cloned into. Can be a `File`, `Path`, or `String`.
uri:: (`String`, default `null`) The URI to the repository to be cloned.
remote:: (`String`, default `origin`) Instead of using the remote name `origin` to keep track of the upstream repository, use `<name>`.
bare:: (`boolean`, default `false`) Create a bare repository.
checkout:: (`boolean`, default `true`) Set to `false` to skip checking out a `HEAD`.
refToCheckout:: (`String`, default `null`) Instead of pointing the newly created `HEAD` to the branch pointed to by the cloned repository’s `HEAD`, point to `<name>` branch instead. In a non-bare repository, this is the branch that will be checked out. This can also take tags and detaches the `HEAD` at that commit in the resulting repository.
credentials:: (`Credentials`, default `null`) An instance of Credentials containing username/password to be used in operations that require authentication. See link:authentication.html[authentication] for preferred ways to configure this.
